Welcome to my blog! My name is Khalil Abu Mushref, and I'm thrilled to start sharing insights, projects, and my journey in technology with you. With a background in Computer Science, a Minor in Mathematics, and experience as the President of the Digipen Student Management Committee, I am deeply passionate about tech, AI, and problem-solving.

## What’s This Blog About?

In this space, I'll be sharing experiences from my journey as a developer, updates on projects like **Virtue: Mental Health Application**, **Wajibaty AI**, and **KPI on the Fly AI**, as well as thoughts on data science, software engineering, and more. My goal is to create a repository of knowledge, share practical insights, and maybe even inspire others on their own tech journey.

Stay tuned for practical tutorials, project breakdowns, and thoughts on the future of technology!
