User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is one of the most critical phases in digital product delivery — yet it is often fragmented, manual, and difficult to manage. Disconnected feedback, unclear ownership, and delayed approvals can slow teams down and compromise release quality.

**SprintsGate** was built to change that.

It is a purpose-built **User Acceptance Testing management platform** designed to bring structure, clarity, and accountability to UAT — enabling agile teams, business users, and leadership to collaborate seamlessly.

## The Vision Behind SprintsGate

SprintsGate was created with a clear objective:
**turn User Acceptance Testing into a streamlined, transparent, and outcome-driven process.**

Instead of relying on spreadsheets, emails, and scattered tools, SprintsGate centralizes all UAT activities into a single platform — from test case execution to feedback, approvals, and reporting.

It closes the gap between **business expectations** and **technical delivery**.
