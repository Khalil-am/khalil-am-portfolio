This project focuses on advanced image processing techniques through feature extraction, enabling detailed analysis of visual data. Various feature extraction methods are applied, including statistical analysis, local binary patterns (LBP), k-means clustering, and image decomposition. This project provides a robust foundation for further applications in fields requiring high-resolution image analysis, such as healthcare, security, and autonomous systems.

## Techniques and Methods

- **Statistical Methods**: Analyzes image distributions and pixel intensity values for basic classification.
- **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)**: Uses LBP for texture classification, aiding in detecting edges, patterns, and surfaces.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Segments images into clusters based on similarity, allowing efficient object recognition and categorization.
- **Image Decomposition**: Breaks down images into component parts for detailed examination and analysis.
