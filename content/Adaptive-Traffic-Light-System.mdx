The Adaptive Traffic Light System is an intelligent traffic solution that uses a PIC16F877A microcontroller to control traffic light operations based on real-time congestion data. The system utilizes sensors to detect vehicle density on various routes and prioritizes routes with the highest congestion by adjusting light timings accordingly.

## Core Functionalities

- **Congestion Based Timing Adjustment**: Automatically detects high-traffic routes and assigns them extended green light durations.
- **Emergency Mode**: Switches to an emergency mode during critical situations, allowing quicker response for emergency vehicles.
- **Single & Dual Mode**: Operates in single mode for isolated routes and dual mode for major intersections, enhancing traffic flow.
- **Low-Power Microcontroller Usage**: Operates efficiently using a PIC16F877A microcontroller, making it suitable for urban and rural setups alike.
